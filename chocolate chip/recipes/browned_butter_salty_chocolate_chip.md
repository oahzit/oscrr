# Browned Butter Salty Chocolate Chip with Chestnut Paste

### Notes
Chestnut paste - popular in France but not commonly found in the US is a delightful stuffing inside these cookies. Their nuttiness complements the warm hazelnut notes of the browned butter, and the consistencey of chestnut paste makes it a perfect stuffing

### Ingredients
2 1/4 cup all-purpose flour

1 1/4 teaspoons baking soda

1/2 teaspoon of salt

8 oz unsalted [no, you cannot sub it with salted] butter

1 1/4 cup packed dark brown sugar

2 tablespoons granulated white sugar

1 large egg plus 1 egg yolk

1 2/3 teaspoons vanilla extract

2 tablespoon whole milk [you can use heavy cream for butterier-tasting cookies]

1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips

1/2 cup dark chocolate chips

1/3 can of chestnut paste

Fleur de sel for sprinkling

### Instructions
1. Whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt in a bowl and set aside.
2. Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat.
	* The butter will begin to foam. Whisk consistently.
	* After a couple of minutes, the butter will begin to brown on the bottom of the saucepan; continue to whisk and remove from heat as soon as the butter begins to brown.
	* Immediately transfer (THIS IS CRUCIAL TO PREVENT BURNING!!) the butter to a bowl to prevent burning. Set aside to cool for a few minutes.
3. Mix the butter and sugars until thoroughly blended. I hear electric mixer is recommended here, but I just used a whisk and did this by hand.
4. Add in the egg, yolk, vanilla, and milk until combined.
5. Add the dry ingredients slowly. Gently fold in all of the chocolate chips.
6. Chill dough for 1 hour in the refrigerator [Do not skip this step! It makes for chewier more moist cookies]
7. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F.
8. Once dough is chilled measure about 1 1/2 tablespoons of dough and roll into a ball.
9. Place dough balls on cookie sheet, 2 inches apart.
10. Flatten cookie dough.
11. Spoon about 1 teaspoon of the chestnut paste into the flattened dough
12. "Roll-up" cookie into a ball again
13. Bake the cookies 9-11 minutes or until the edges of the cookies begin to turn golden brown.
	* They will look a bit underdone in the middle, but will continue to cook once out of the oven.
14. Sprinkle with fleur de sel as soon as they come out of the oven
